# burger

# Overview

This app is a fully functioning full stack application.  It is a bootstrap driven UI with a backend powered by express, node and MySQL.  The SQL database stores and displays all of the items that you add.  You can add whatever items to the list you want.  The app originally started out as being a way to track the different types of burgers the user eats.  Instead, I put a twist on the theme by switching it to wines instead!
